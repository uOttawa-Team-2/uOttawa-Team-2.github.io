        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        A program with integrated motion tracking technology and cameras, created to judge the technical elements of synchronized swimming.
        The movements of the swimmers will be tracked and evaluated by the program. Using a database, the system will compare optimal performances to the swimmer, and calculates a score. 
        The full product aims to remove judge bias from the technical elements of synchronized swimming performances.

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
            The system consist in an arrangement of different cameras that track the movements of the athletes. The systemen is able to distinguish body parts, and then implements the movement to an animated virtual "skeleton" of each athletes. We have associated with professionals and judges, following the exact evaluated criteria, to conceive an immense database of all perfect movement execution. Thereby, our algorithms can compare, impartially, every movements and positioning to formulate a result representative  of the actual perfomance.
