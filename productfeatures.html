                The system consists of an arrangement of different cameras that track the movements of athletes.
                <br><br>
                The system is able to distinguish body parts, and then it implements the movement to an animated virtual "skeleton" of each athlete.
                <br><br>
                We have associated with professionals and judges, following the exact evaluated criteria, to conceive an immense database of all perfect movement execution.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, our algorithms can compare, impartially, every movement and positioning to formulate a result representative of the actual perfomance.
