            The system consist in an arrangement of different cameras that track the movements of the athletes.
            The system is able to distinguish body parts, and then implements the movement to an animated virtual "skeleton" of each athletes.
            We have associated with professionals and judges, following the exact evaluated criteria, to conceive an immense database of all perfect movement execution.
            Thereby, our algorithms can compare, impartially, every movements and positioning to formulate a result representative  of the actual perfomance.
