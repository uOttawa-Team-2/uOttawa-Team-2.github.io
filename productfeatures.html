        <p>
            The system consists of an arrangement of different cameras that track the movements of athletes.
            The system is able to distinguish body parts, and then it implements the movement to an animated virtual "skeleton" of each athlete.
            We have associated with professionals and judges, following the exact evaluated criteria, to conceive an immense database of all perfect movement execution.
            Therefore, our algorithms can compare, impartially, every movement and positioning to formulate a result representative of the actual perfomance.
